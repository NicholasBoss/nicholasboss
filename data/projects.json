Whereas in most games, spikes would damage the player. However, we didn't want to make things too simple by merely flipping all \"bad\" things to be good and all \"good\" things to be bad. Some things still behave how the player would expect. Our enemies are still bad, like they are in any other game. By not doing a straight good to bad and bad to good flip, we force the player to think and experiment with new concepts."

Currently, we still have some organization, but we would like to make it simpler and split some of the larger files into many smaller files."

For the sake of completing other requirements, we pushed off animations. We created all our graphics from scratch except for the background. Drawing multiple frames to make animations possible is time consuming. We merely ran out of time to finish and implement animations, though, we intend to continue working and implement animations in the future. As we worked on the project, we kept a list of additional ideas that we wanted to include. Even though we ended up not adding animations, we were able to implement slightly more than 2/3 of our additional ideas."
